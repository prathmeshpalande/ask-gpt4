            response = 'To include an optional multi-file upload for images in your Streamlit application and provide a boilerplate function for handling the uploaded images, you can follow the steps below. I\'ll add a section for uploading images and a placeholder function where you can later add the code for processing or attaching these images along with the question.\n\nFirst, let\'s add the multi-file upload option for images right after the section where the user enters their question. We\'ll support common image file types like JPEG and PNG. Then, we\'ll create a boilerplate function called `process_uploaded_images` where you can later add the logic for handling the images.\n\nHere\'s how you can modify your Streamlit application:\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\nimport datetime\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n@st.cache_data\ndef call_chat_completions_api(\n    model,\n    message,\n    response_format="text",\n    system_message=None,\n    messages=None,\n    stream=False,\n    temperature=0,\n):\n    if not messages:\n        messages = []\n        if system_message:\n            messages.append({"role": "system", "content": system_message})\n    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": message})\n\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        response_format={\n            "type": "text" if response_format == "text" else "json_object"\n        },\n        temperature=temperature,\n        stream=stream,\n        model=model,\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n    return response\n\n@st.cache_data\ndef generate_file_name(uploaded_file_name):\n    return f\'{str(datetime.datetime.now()).replace(":", "-")}-{uploaded_file_name}\'\n\n@st.cache_data\ndef write_to_disk(file_path, open_type, _data):\n    with open(file_path, open_type) as f:\n        f.write(_data)\n\n# Placeholder function for processing uploaded images\ndef process_uploaded_images(uploaded_files):\n    # Placeholder for your image processing code\n    # You can modify this function to attach images with the question or any other processing\n    for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:\n        # For now, just generate a file name for each uploaded image\n        file_name = generate_file_name(uploaded_file.name)\n        # Here you will add your code to process or attach images\n        st.write(f"Processed {file_name}")  # Placeholder feedback\n\n# Main Streamlit app\ndef main():\n    st.title("Ask GPT 4")\n\n    # Ask a question\n    st.subheader("Ask a Question")\n    message = st.text_area("Enter your question here")\n\n    # Upload images (optional)\n    st.subheader("Upload Images (optional)")\n    uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Choose images", type=[\'jpg\', \'jpeg\', \'png\'], accept_multiple_files=True)\n\n    if st.button("Send"):\n        # Process question and provide response\n        response = call_chat_completions_api(\n            model="gpt-4-0125-preview",\n            message=message,\n            response_format="text",\n        )\n        st.subheader("Response")\n        response_text = response.choices[0].message.content\n        st.write(response_text)\n\n        file_path = os.path.join("qa", f"qa-{hash(message)}.txt")\n        write_to_disk(\n            file_path,\n            "w",\n            f"""\n            {message = }\n\n            {response_text = }\n            """,\n        )\n\n        # Process uploaded images if any\n        if uploaded_files:\n            process_uploaded_images(uploaded_files)\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this updated version, users can upload multiple images along with their question. The `process_uploaded_images` function is currently a placeholder where you can later add the specific logic for handling the images, such as attaching them to the question or performing any preprocessing required before sending them along with the API call or saving them to disk.'
