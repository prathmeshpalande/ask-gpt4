            response = 'The regular expression you posted is a common pattern used for validating emails, and while it covers many general cases for email validation, it may lack precision, especially in terms of fully aligning with all the rules specified by the Internet standards for email addresses (RFCs 5321 and 5322).\n\nHowever, the regular expression provided can indeed handle most common email validation requirements. If you are experiencing issues, it could be due to edge cases not handled by this pattern or requirements specific to your application that are not addressed by this expression.\n\nHere\'s a brief breakdown of your current regex:\n1. **User part**: `[a-z]`, numbers, periods, and special characters excluding angle brackets, commas, and whitespace.\n2. **Domain part**: Either IP address in square brackets or a domain name with at least one dot and two letters at the end.\n\nThe regex can be considered correct for general usage, but it can be refined or extended based on specific needs or to handle more complex cases. If you\'re facing errors related to literal interpretation or if you need stricter validation in line with the latest email format standards, you might want to consider adjustments. \n\nHere\'s an improved version based on the same structure but slightly optimized:\n\n```regex\n/^(?:(?!.*\\.{2,}.*)(?:[\\w!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[\\w!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"[^<>()[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@"]*"))@(?:(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}|(\\[[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}]))$/\n```\n\n**Changes Made:**\n1. **Local Part**: The local part ensures there are no consecutive dots using `(?!.*\\.{2,}.*)(...)`;\n2. **Domain**: The domain-name validation remains mostly unchanged as `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.` which means one or more alphanumeric characters and hyphens followed by a literal dot. The TLD (Top Level Domain) must be at least two alphabetical characters long.\n\n**Note**: Email validation can be very complex owing to the wide diversity of valid formats, and using regex for this purpose has limitations. No regular expression can perfectly validate every possible valid email address, particularly if new TLDs are added or international characters are considered. For critical applications, it\'s often recommended to use validation libraries, or to send a confirmation email as a form of verification which also covers correct delivery.\n\nIf specific issues or edge cases are affecting your application, please share these scenarios for more targeted help.'
