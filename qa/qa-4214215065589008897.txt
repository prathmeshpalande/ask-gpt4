            response = 'The issue that you\'re experiencing with the 307 Temporary Redirect is arising because of a mismatch between the route defined in your FastAPI application and the URL used in the fetch request from your React Native application.\n\nIn your FastAPI application, the route for the login endpoint is defined with a trailing slash `/login/`. However, in your React Native fetch request, you are using the URL without a trailing slash (`http://192.168.1.4:65535/login`). FastAPI, by design, adds a redirect from the non-trailing-slash version of a URL to the trailing-slash version (assuming one exists), which results in the 307 Temporary Redirect response.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to make sure the URLs match in terms of whether or not they use a trailing slash. Here are two ways to address this:\n\n1. **Adjust the URL in the React Native Code**: Update the URL in the fetch request in your React Native code to match the FastAPI definition by adding a trailing slash:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const response = await fetch(\'http://192.168.1.4:65535/login/\', {\n       method: \'POST\',\n       headers: {\n           \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',\n       },\n       body: JSON.stringify({ email }),\n   });\n   ```\n\n   Notice the addition of the trailing slash in the URL `http://192.168.1.4:65535/login/`.\n\n2. **Adjust the Route in the FastAPI Code**: If you prefer not to use the trailing slash in your URLs, you can modify the route definition in your FastAPI application by removing the trailing slash:\n\n   ```python\n   @app.post("/login")\n   def login(user_in: UserIn, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       ...\n   ```\n\n   This approach will align the FastAPI endpoint with the original URL used in your React Native fetch request.\n\nChanging either side should resolve the 307 Temporary Redirect issue, but you\'ll want to be consistent moving forward about how you define and call your API endpoints with regard to trailing slashes. It\'s generally a good practice to standardize across your application whether to include or exclude trailing slashes for clarity and consistency.'
